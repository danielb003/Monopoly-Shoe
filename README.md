## Project Description
Prolific Trading is an application we are designing for our project for Programming Project 01. The application is a trading game that allows users to test their skills on the cryptocurrency market without having to invest any finances. It will use real world data by utilising publicly available cryptocurrency APIâ€™s to allow our application to reflect real cryptocurrency market trends.
