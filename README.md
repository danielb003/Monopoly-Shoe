# Programming Project 1 - Prolific Trading
## Project Team:

## Project Description
Prolific Trading is an application we are designing for our project for Programming Project 01. 
The application is a trading game that allows users to test their skills on the cryptocurrency market without having to invest any finances. 
It will use real world data by utilising publicly available cryptocurrency APIâ€™s to allow our application to reflect real cryptocurrency market trends. 

## Technologies

* React:
Chosen as our main technology as we were delivering a responsive web site that required functionality around API interactions and this was best delivered in a React application. 
* Firebase DB:
Chosen as our database back end as we were working with API data in JSON format and so Firebase was a natural choice for storing our data without any additional parsing.
* Firebase Hosting: 
Chose to host the single page web app in Firebase as we were already using it for hosting our database; so it made sense to also host the web application there.
